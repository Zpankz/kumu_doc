# How do I change the default for currency fields?

Kumu allows you to change your [field type](../guides/fields.md#field-type) to 'currency', so that currency values are nicely styled with a currency sign. The default is the dollar sign - $, but if you'd like to change this to any other currency, take the following steps:&#x20;

1. Click on the [Project Settings](../overview/settings.md) menu in the top-left corner of your Kumu project
2. Choose the 'Fields' tab
3. Click on the field that you'd like to change the currency for
4. Make sure 'Type' is set to 'Currency' and then you can click on the dropdown next to 'Currency' to change it
5. Save your changes all the way at the bottom
