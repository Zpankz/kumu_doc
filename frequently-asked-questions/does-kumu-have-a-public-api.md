# Does Kumu have a public API?

In short: No, we don't.&#x20;

**Here are two alternative options:**&#x20;

* Connect any third-party program to a Google Sheet, and have that sheet feed into Kumu in real-time. [Read our Ultimate Guide on Google Sheets here](https://blog.kumu.io/the-ultimate-guide-to-using-google-sheets-with-kumu-d46e96fd47a8).&#x20;
* Set up a remote JSON link to feed into Kumu. Note that this option is a bit more advanced, and not recommended if you're not familiar with JSON files/links. [Learn more about importing data through a JSON link here.](../guides/import/blueprints.md#set-a-remote-json-link)&#x20;
