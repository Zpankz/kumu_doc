# Where can I find example Kumu projects?

There's multiple options to find existing Kumu projects to draw inspiration from:&#x20;

* [Visit the Kumu Gallery](https://kumu.io/gallery) for a quick overview of our favorite maps
* Need some more inspiration? [Find some Kumu Projects in the Wild here](https://kumu.io/kumu/projects-in-the-wild#projects-in-the-wild) with an ever-growing database of Kumu projects and presentations created by actual Kumu users (Want to add your Kumu project to this map? [Submit it here.](https://form.typeform.com/to/aUUuSLnj))
* You can search _any_ public project in the [Kumu Public Project Database](https://kumu.io/community). Note that not all of these are "finished" projects, as they really include _all_ existing public projects. We recommend to focus on projects with a high number of views, or to click the :"Presentations" tab with published presentations.
* Need inspiration on how to structure your data? Find some data sets and their accompanying maps in our ["Public data sets to import" folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1_xoIFJ2snCcxta1Fw8AwrxWCe5YlKXCW)
