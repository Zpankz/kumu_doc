# Where can I find example Kumu projects?

There's multiple options to find existing Kumu projects to draw inspiration from:&#x20;

* [Visit the Kumu Gallery](https://kumu.io/gallery)
* Find data sets and their accompanying maps in our ["Public data sets to import" folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1\_xoIFJ2snCcxta1Fw8AwrxWCe5YlKXCW)
* You can search any public project in the [Kumu Public Project Database](https://kumu.io/community). Note that not all of these are "finished" projects, as they really include _all_ existing public projects.&#x20;
* Need some inspiration? [Find some Kumu Projects in the Wild here](https://kumu.io/kumu/projects-in-the-wild#projects-in-the-wild). (Want to add your Kumu project to this map? [Submit it here.](https://form.typeform.com/to/aUUuSLnj))
