# Does Kumu make use of AI?

No, we don't offer any (integrated) AI features within Kumu, for now.&#x20;

Nevertheless, you _can_ use AI for data gathering when building a Kumu map. We've written a blog on how to do that with ChatGPT. [Find it here. ](https://blog.kumu.io/exploring-how-to-avoid-climate-disaster-with-kumu-and-chatgpt-76ecf7dff092)

We've also created a video on how to use ChatGPT when systems mapping for our 12 Days of Kumu Christmas last year, [which you can find here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJHoGNfHJXI).&#x20;
