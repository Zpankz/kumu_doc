# How do I save my changes in Kumu?

"Oops! Did that change get saved?!" Let’s make sure you never have to ask that again! Saving your work in Kumu is straightforward, but it's essential to know when and how to do it to ensure your changes stick.

## Saving your data

There's two distinctions to make based on _how_ you're adding data into your map:&#x20;

**Entering data by hand**

If you're [building your Kumu map by hand](../getting-started/first-steps.md#build-your-map-by-hand), then you're manually creating elements and connections by hand and then filling out the information in each item's [profile](../guides/profiles.md). Here are the rules:&#x20;

* Creating an element or connection auto-saves
* Save the [**Label**](../guides/fields.md#label) by hitting Enter (Return for Macbook) on your keyboard
* Save the [**Element Type**](../guides/fields.md#type) or [**Description**](../guides/fields.md#description) by clicking the blue "Done" button below the field
* Save any individual [**Tags**](../guides/fields.md#tags) by hitting Enter (Return for Macbook) on your keyboard and then click anywhere outside of the field to exit editing the **Tags** field
* Save any [**custom fields**](../guides/fields.md#add-a-custom-field) by hitting Enter (Return for Macbook) on your keyboard, or refer to the Tags bullet point above for [multiple-value fields](../guides/fields.md#customize-a-field)

**Importing data into Kumu**

If you're importing data, then all elements, connection and profile information auto-save once imported.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If you imported your data through [Excel](../guides/import/excel-csv.md) or [JSON file](../guides/import/blueprints.md#import-a-json-file), you can continue editing in Kumu as per the steps in the section "Entering data by hand" above. If you imported your data through [Google Sheets](../guides/import/google-sheets.md) or [remote JSON link](../guides/import/blueprints.md#set-a-remote-json-link) you cannot edit in Kumu directly, and all changes must be made in either of those sources directly.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Basic & Advanced Editor

Clicking Settings on the left side of your map opens the [Basic Editor](../overview/view-editors.md#basic-editor) & the [Advanced Editor](../overview/advanced-editor-hub/). Here is where you work on the visualization of your map by creating [decorations](../guides/decorate.md), updating [the structure of your map](../overview/view-editors.md#connect-by), or creating [controls](../guides/controls.md).&#x20;

Whether you're using the Basic Editor or the Advanced Editor, Kumu **does not** automatically save your changes. After making any adjustments, you'll notice a prompt at the bottom of the editor offering a few options: `APPLY*`, `SAVE` or `REVERT` :

* **APPLY:** Click this to show the effect of your changes to the Advanced Editor **without** saving it. (\*Only shows if the "Automatically apply changes" checkbox is unchecked.)&#x20;
* **SAVE**: Click this to saves your changes.
* **REVERT**: Select this to discard your recent edits and return to the last saved version of the Advanced Editor.

## Map description

To save the changes in your map description, simply click the blue "Done" button at the bottom of the map description.

## Project Settings

These are the rules for changing settings in a few of the features in the [Project Settings](../overview/settings.md#project-settings) section:

### Presentations

To save changes when creating a presentation, click the blue "Save changes" button in the bottom-left corner of the presentation editor.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If you've already published your presentation but make updates to your Kumu map afterward, be sure to click 'Publish' again, and then select 'Update presentation' to reflect the changes.
{% endhint %}

### Field Settings

Updating any field in the [Field Settings](../guides/fields.md) requires you to scroll down to the bottom and click the blue "Save button".&#x20;

### Members

[Adding a member](../overview/collaboration.md#add-a-contributor) as a Manager, Contributor or Observer auto-saves once you can see them below any of these three categories.
