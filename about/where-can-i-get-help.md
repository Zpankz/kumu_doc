# Where can I get help?

These docs are a great place to start. We've broken down the guides into sections based on where you are in your journey using Kumu. If you're just getting started, make sure to watch the [five-minute quickstart video](/#five-minute-quickstart). Already proficient, but looking for deeper understanding? Check our guides on the disciplines of [system mapping](/guides/system-mapping.md) and [social network analysis](/guides/sna-network-mapping.md), or read more about [Kumu's architecture](/overview/kumus-architecture.md).

We may be a small team, but our customer service is mighty. If you ever need help you can email us at [support@kumu.io](mailto:support@kumu.io), tweet to [@kumupowered](https://www.twitter.com/kumupowered), or [chat with us](http://chat.kumu.io/) on Slack.
