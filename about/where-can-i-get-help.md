# Where can I get help?

These docs are a great place to start. We've broken down the guides into sections based on where you are in your journey using Kumu.&#x20;

If you're just getting started, make sure to watch the [five-minute quickstart video](../README%20\(1\).md#five-minute-quickstart).&#x20;

Already proficient, but looking for deeper understanding? Check our guides on the disciplines of [system mapping](../guides/system-mapping.md) and [social network analysis](../guides/sna-network-mapping.md), or read more about [Kumu's architecture](../overview/kumus-architecture.md).

We may be a small team, but our customer service is mighty. If you ever need help you can email us at [support@kumu.io](mailto:support@kumu.io) or [chat with us](http://chat.kumu.io/) on Slack.
