# Selector reference

Selectors provide a powerful, friendly way to slice through maps, based on [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) selectors.

If you're familiar with CSS, you'll feel right at home. If you haven't seen or used CSS, don't worry! All the selector patterns you'll ever need are documented in this reference. To see examples of how selectors can be used, check out our [general guide on selectors](selectors.md).

There are two reference tables on this page. The first shows you all the different kinds of selectors you can use in Kumu, and the second table gives details about logical operators that can be used inside of certain selectors.

In the first table, you'll notice that the word "slug" appears a lot. A [slug](../../guides/slugs.md) is a piece of text that has had all letters converted to lowercase, all special characters removed, and all spaces and replaced with hyphens. So, when you see something like `type-slug` in the table below, this will be replaced in your custom selector with something like `private-company` or `individual` or another "slug" version of an element type.
