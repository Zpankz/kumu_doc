# User Interfaces

At Kumu, we try to make it as easy as possible for you to get ideas out of your head and onto the screen, so that you can spend less time fiddling with menus and modals, and more time winning hearts and minds with your awesome visualizations! The key to all of that lies in Kumu's user interfacesâ€”the tools that you use to create elements, connections, and loops, to design views, to build maps, and to assemble a project that draws insight from your data.

We're constantly iterating on these interfaces to make them more effective and intuitive, so if you ever have suggestions, don't hesitate to [let us know](/about/where-can-i-get-help.md).

Here are a few guides on how to use Kumu's current interfaces:

- [Map editor](/overview/map-editor.md)
- [View editors](/overview/view-editors.md)
- [Settings](/overview/settings.md)
