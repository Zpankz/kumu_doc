## Caveats when transferring projects

To transfer a project into a Pro workspace, you first need to be [added as an owner](/guides/pro-workspaces.md#add-users-to-a-pro-workspace) of the Pro workspace (if you created the Pro workspace, you are an owner by default).

If you see an "Unable to transfer project" error after trying to transfer a project, here is how you can troubleshoot:
1. Ensure that the recipient (the workspace you're transferring to) does not have a project with the same name. If they do have a project with the same name, rename one of the projects, and try transferring again.
2. If you are transferring a private project, make sure that the recipient has added a credit card in their billing settings, and that they have not met or exceeded their private project limit (annual plans only).
