# How do I add arrows to my connections?

<p class="alert alert-warning">
Arrows can't be added to connections if you're using the <a class="alert-link" href="/guides/templates.html#sna-social-network-analysis-template">SNA template</a>.
</p>

If you want to add arrows to your connections to specify direction, here are a couple ways to do so:

### For a single connection

* Select the connection.
* Use the direction icon <i class="fa fa-exchange">  </i> in the [side panel](/overview/map-editor.md#side-panel) to specify "Directed", "Mutual", or reverse <i class="fa fa-random"></i> the connection direction.
* Click "Directed" to add a connection arrow, and "Mutual" to add an arrow on each side.

### For all connections

* Press `Shift` + `C` on your keyboard to select all connections.
* Click on the direction icon <i class="fa fa-exchange">  </i> in the side panel.
* Click "Directed" to add arrows to all connections.


### For a specific group of connections

* Click the Search bar at the top of the map, then click the rocket icon <i class="fa fa-rocket">  </i> on the far right to bring up the selector builder.
* Use the selector builder to select the connections that you want to change, based on the information in their profiles.
* Click on the direction icon <i class="fa fa-exchange">  </i> in the side panel.
* Click "Directed" to add arrows to your selected connections.


### For imported connections and connections created by clustering

If your connections are imported from Excel, imported from a remote source ([Google Sheets](/guides/import.html#import-from-google-sheets) or a [JSON blueprint](/guides/blueprints.html#set-a-remote-blueprint)), or created by [clustering](/guides/clustering.html), you can add arrows by changing the default map settings:

* [Open the map settings](/overview/settings.html#map-settings)
* Click **Default connection direction**
* Choose **Directed** to add arrows to one end, and choose **Mutual** to add arrows to both ends

You can also add arrows to imported connections if you include a `direction` field in your import file (for example, by adding a new spreadsheet column titled `direction`). In that field, you can use one of the following values (must be entered in all lowercase letters):
- `directed`
- `undirected`
- `mutual`

<p class="alert alert-warning">
When you're imported from a connected Google Sheet or JSON blueprint, you can only choose <strong>one</strong> connection direction. All of the connections in your map will have that same direction.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
Kumu recognizes connection direction from your spreadsheet import (<strong>From</strong> and <strong>To</strong> columns in your connections sheet) or the direction you draw the connection by hand. This connection direction determines which way arrows point when you specify a "directed" connection.
