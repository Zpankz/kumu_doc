# How do I copy a map to another project?

To copy or transfer a map into a brand new project that has no other content inside of it, you can simply [fork the original project](/guides/forking.html), then [delete any maps and views](/faq/how-do-i-delete-a-project-map-or-view.html) that you don't need. After deleting any content, it's usually helpful to [empty the trash](/faq/how-do-i-delete-data-from-my-project.html) as well. If you take this forking approach, you'll be able to copy not just the map data (elements, connections, and loops), but also the accompanying view.

But, if the project you're transferring _to_ already has some content of its own, which you don't want to delete or override, things get a little more complex. You can copy individual maps over with the help of [this tool](/faq/how-do-i-avoid-duplicating-data). 


If you're encountering any difficulties, please reach out to support@kumu.io, and we can help you move the map and any accompanying views safely, without deleting or overriding data in the target project.
