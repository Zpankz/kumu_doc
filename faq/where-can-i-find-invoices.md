# Where can I find my invoices? 

There's two ways to view your invoices: 

1. Invoices and receipts are automatically sent to the email address connected to your account. In case you indicated a separate billing email address, then they will be sent there. Searching through your inbox should allow you to find all of your invoices.

2. You can also find all of your invoices/receips in the billing area of your account. To get there: 
  - click on the Workspaces tab in your Kumu dashboard 
  - choose the relevant workspace 
  - scroll down to Billing History. You can view and download all your invoices there. 

If you're still missing a certain invoice, please send an email to support@kumu.io and we'll be happy to help find it!
