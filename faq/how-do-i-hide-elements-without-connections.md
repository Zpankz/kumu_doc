# How do I hide elements without connections?

Elements without any connections are called "orphans" and might sometimes distract from your main map.

To hide orphans in your map, use the `ignore-orphans` property in the `@settings` block to automatically filter out any elements that have no connections. Possible values for this property are `true` or `false`.

```scss
@settings {
    ignore-orphans: true;
}
```

## Dynamic hiding of orphans

**With a control**\
You might not _always_ want to hide the orphans in your map. To add a handy control to your map that toggles orphans on and off whenever needed, add this code to your advanced editor:

```scss
@controls {
 top {
 filter {
  target: :orphan;
  as: label;

  option {
    selector: *;
    default: true;
    label: "Hide elements without connections";
   }
  }
 }
}
```

To adjust the location or aesthetic of your control, visit the [Controls guide](../guides/controls.md).

**Automatic**\
If you want the hiding of orphans to be a bit more automatic, simply add `filter-ignore-orphans: true;` to your `@settings {` block and Kumu will automatically ignore orphans when you activate your filter. It'll look like this:&#x20;

```
@settings {
filter-ignore-orphans: true;
}
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
_One caveat: this "automatic" way to ignore orphans only works on elements that were never connected in the first place. Any elements that do have connections when the filter isnâ€™t activated will not be filtered out._
{% endhint %}
