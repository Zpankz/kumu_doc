# How can I remove unwanted legend entries from my map?

If you are seeing entries in your legend that you don ªt recognize and want to remove, it is likely that these are element type values 
automatically created for you based on the template you select. To remove them, click the project settings menu in the upper left corner,
click on "fields", and then click on "element type". You can then click the delete icon for the values you want to remove and when you 
refresh the page you will no longer see them listed.
