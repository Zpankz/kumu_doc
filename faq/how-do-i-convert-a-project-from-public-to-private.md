## Caveats when converting public projects to private

You will only be able to convert a **public** project to **private** if you have a paid workspace. To make sure you have a paid workspace, go to the billing settings for your workspace, where you can add your payment information.

If you are on an annual billing plan, you may also need to go to your billing settings to raise your private project limit.
