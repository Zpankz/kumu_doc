2. Select **Admin** from the sidebar
3. Click on "Make this project private" under the **Change privacy** section

## Caveats when converting public projects to private

You will only be able to convert a **public** project to **private** if you have a payment method added to your account. To add one, please navigate to the [Workspaces tab](https://kumu.io/dashboard#workspaces) in your Dashboard > choose the workspace for which you'd like to update the payment method > click on Add Card to add your payment information.&#x20;

If you are on an [Annual billing plan](../overview/billing.md#annual-billing), you may also need to go to your billing settings to raise your private project limit. Find out how to do this in [this guide](../overview/billing.md#adding-private-projects-to-the-annual-plan).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Can't pay with credit card? Kumu only offers invoicing for [annual plans](../overview/billing.md#annual-billing). If you'd like to switch to annual invoicing, please contact [billing@kumu.io](mailto:billing@kumu.io).&#x20;
