# How do I remove the "Opposite" entry from my legend? 

Some legend entries get added automatically when you apply different templates.

The **Opposite** entry is a default setting of the System Template. To remove it, follow these steps: 

1. Click on the Settings icon  on the right side of your map
2. Then click on **MORE OPTIONS** and select **Customize view defaults** from the menu
3. Delete the word "Opposite" from the text box behind "Opposite connection label" (or change it to something else)
4. Click Save in the yellow bar at the bottom of the Settings menu

You're all set!
