# Creating user accounts  

Once you have installed and configured Enterprise, create your first user account by visiting `<hostname>/register`.

## Assigning an admin

Until you explicitly assign an admin, all user accounts you create will have admin access to manage both users and projects (note: this is different from admin access to the underlying application settings).

Make sure to assign at least one user as an admin by following the below steps:

1. Visit `<hostname>/admin`
2. Click the "edit" link next to the desired user
3. Check the box for "admin"

## Inviting others to create user accounts

You can share the below URL to let others create a user account:

`<hostname>/register`

You'll be able to create as many accounts as you have seats on your Enterprise license.
