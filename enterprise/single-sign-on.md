# Single sign-on

Single sign-on allows users to sign into your Kumu Enterprise instance using your existing SAML 2.0 identity provider.

Here are a few links to the documentation for common providers:
  - [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-single-sign-on-non-gallery-applications)
  - [Google Suite](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6087519?hl=en)

SSL must be enabled to use SSO to log into your instance.

When setting up your app, you can use `Kumu` as the app name, and for the Entity ID, you should enter the following, replacing `example` with the subdomain of your instance:

  ```
  https://example.kumuenterprise.com
  ```

For the Reply URL (Azure) or ACS URL (Google Suite), use the following, once again replacing `example` with the subdomain of your instance:

  ```
  https://example.kumuenterprise.com/sso/saml/consume
  ```

Set the name identifier to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` and provide attribute assertions for `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `username`. If you do not provide a username one will be generated automatically from the email address.

If you are using Enterprise Cloud, please provide Kumu with the following so we can configure your instance for you:

- entity ID
- service URL
- base-64 encoded public certificate

If you are self-hosting, please visit https://example.com/enterprise/admin/settings and sign in with your admin account. From your SSO provider, you can get an entity ID, service URL, and a base-64 encoded public certificate. Check the box to enable SSO for your enterprise instance and copy/paste those items into your instance's settings:

With Kumu and your SSO provider configured, you can use your SSO provider to give users access to Kumu. Users can begin the sign-in flow by visiting the url below and clicking the "Sign in via single sign-on (SSO)" button:

   ```
   https://example.kumuenterprise.com/login
   ```
