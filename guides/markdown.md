# Markdown

## Markdown

Markdown is an easy and powerful way to format your descriptions and long text fields using simple, natural syntax.

### The basics

```md
*italic* and **bold**
```

\-> Creates _italic_ and **bold**

```md
An inline link: [Kumu](http://launch.kumupowered.com)
```

\-> Creates an inline link: [Kumu](http://launch.kumupowered.com)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that inline links always open the website in the same tab and direct your viewer away from your Kumu map. If you wish to open the link in a separate tab, you can use the following HTML syntax:&#x20;

`<a href="https://kumu.io" target="_blank">Kumu website</a>`

Replace the URL with your own and swap the word "Kumu website" for any word(s) you'd like your viewers to click. Make sure that target= stays the same.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

```md
An auto-generated link: http://kumu.io
```

\-> Creates an auto-generated link: [https://kumu.io](https://kumu.io)

### Lists

```md
* Milk
* Cookies
* Marshmallows
```

Looks like:

* Milk
* Cookies
* Marshmallows

```md
1. California
2. Texas
3. New York
```

Looks like:

1. California
2. Texas
3. New York

### Links within your account

We also support linking to elements, connections and loops (even other maps in your account).

You can use the following syntax:

**Selectors**

```md
[link text](= selector)
```

Replace `link text` with the text for your link, and replace `selector` with any valid [selector](../overview/advanced-editor-hub/selectors.md).

**Maps**

```md
[link text](#map-slug)
```

Replace `link text` with the text for your link, and replace `map-slug` with the [slug](slugs.md) of your map.

**Views**

```md
[link text](#map-slug/view-slug)
```

Replace `link text` with the text for your link, replace `map-slug` with the [slug](slugs.md) of your map, and replace `view-slug` .with the [slug](slugs.md) of your view.

### Images

```md
![alt text](image-url)
```

Replace `alt text` with an image caption that screen readers can read, and replace `image-url` with a link to your image.

#### Widgets

See our guide to [widgets](markdown.md#widgets) to learn more about embedding videos, podcasts, slideshows, and other interactive content inside markdown.

### Headings

```md
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

Looks like:

## Heading 1

### Heading 2

#### Heading 3

**Heading 4**

**Heading 5**

**Heading 6**

{% endhint %}

### Code

Simply indent lines with four spaces or wrap the code with three backticks:

````
```md
<div class="footer">
    &copy; 2013 Kumu Systems LLC
</div>
```
````

Looks like:

```md
<div class="footer">
    &copy; 2013 Kumu Systems LLC
</div>
```

### Blockquotes

```
> Add quote text here
```

Looks like:

> Add quote text here

### Tables

```md
One | Two | Three
--- | --- | ---
Blue | White | Gray
Green | Yellow | Red
```

If you are using Markdown in the Description column of an [import](import/), you will have to use the [HTML table tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag\_table.asp) rather than the usual Markdown syntax. Make sure to remove all line breaks from your HTML, or your table will render with a large white space above it.

<<<<<<< HEAD

```md
=======
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

> > > > > > > 542c98f (GitBook: \[#18] fixes some busted content in markdown docs)

| One   | Two    | Three |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| Blue  | White  | Gray  |
| Green | Yellow | Red   |

\`\`\` ======= | One | Two | Three | | ----- | ------ | ----- | | Blue | White | Gray | | Green | Yellow | Red |

### Horizontal Rules

```
Three or more dashes or asterisks
---
***
```

### Inline HTML

Kumu's markdown editor also recognizes a limited amount of inline HTML.&#x20;

### LaTeX

Good news for people using Kumu in science, math, or academiaâ€”anywhere you write Markdown in Kumu, you can also write LaTeX to include equations!

You can write LaTeX inline or on its own separate line. To write inline, put two dollar signs on either side of your LaTeX code, like so:

```md
24 minutes are $$\frac{24}{60}=0.4h$$ and $$\sin(30^o)=0.5$$
```

Here's what you would see:

![rendered inline latex](../images/latex-inline.png)

Or, for more complex expressions, you can write inside a codeblock marked as `latex`, like so:

````
```latex
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
    \,d\xi
```
````

Here's what you would see:

![rendered block latex](../images/latex-block.png)

Kumu uses a tool called KaTeX to render these equations. For a full list of supported equations, [visit the KaTeX docs](https://katex.org/docs/supported.md).
