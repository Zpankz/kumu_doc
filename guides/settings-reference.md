# @settings reference

In the [Advanced Editor](../overview/view-editors.md#advanced-editor), the `@settings` block can be used to tweak default settings and add all kinds of powerful features to your view.

The `@settings` block supports all decoration properties listed in the [property reference](property-reference.md), as long as you prefix each property with one of the following:

* `*-` if you want to apply the rule to all items
* `element-` to apply the rule to elements only
* `connection-` to apply the rule to connections only
* `loop-` to apply the rule to loops only

But, `@settings` also supports its own list of exclusive properties. The table below lists all properties that can be used exclusively inside an `@settings` block, describes their effect on the view, and lists valid values for each property (when there are multiple valid values, we've listed them as separate snippets of `inline code`).

There are just few more things you should know about the valid values listed below:

| Where you see... | You can use...                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `selector`       | Any [selector](selectors.md)                                                    |
| `color`          | Any CSS web color or hex color code                                             |
| `number`         | Any number                                                                      |
| `'field name'`   | The name of any of your [fields](fields.md), wrapped in single or double quotes |
| `element type`   | Any text/string value                                                           |

All values are unitless.
