2. Select **Project**
3. Select the action you want to perform

Alternatively, you can:

1. Open the [project settings menu](../overview/settings.md#project-settings)
2. Select **Admin** from the sidebar
3. Select the action you want to perform

## Caveats when converting public projects to private

You will only be able to convert a **public** project to **private** if you have a paid workspace. To make sure you have a paid workspace, go to the billing settings for your workspace, where you can add your payment information.

If you are on an annual billing plan, you may also need to go to your billing settings to raise your private project limit.

## Caveats when transferring projects

To transfer a project into a Pro workspace, you first need to be [added as an owner](pro-workspaces.md#add-users-to-a-pro-workspace) of the Pro workspace (if you created the Pro workspace, you are an owner by default).

If you see an "Unable to transfer project" error after trying to transfer a project, here is how you can troubleshoot:

1. Ensure that the recipient (the workspace you're transferring to) does not have a project with the same name. If they do have a project with the same name, rename one of the projects, and try transferring again.
2. If you are transferring a private project, make sure that the recipient has added a credit card in their billing settings, and that they have not met or exceeded their private project limit (annual plans only).
