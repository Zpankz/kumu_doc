# URLs

Kumu URLs follow a predictable pattern: every URL starts with `https://kumu.io` and ends with one of the options described in the table below. When you're visiting Kumu links or sending them to your friends, colleagues, and collaborators, this table will help you know exactly what you're linking to.

Before you dive in: if you're not sure what we mean by `slug` in the table below, check out [our full guide on slugs](/guides/slugs.md).

| Link's destination | URL format |
| --- | --- |
| Your account dashboard | `/dashboard` |
| Your account settings | `/settings` |
| A workspace's dashboard and settings | `/<workspace name slug>/settings` |
| A public Kumu profile | `/<username>` |
| A Kumu project | `/<workspace name slug>/<project name slug>` |
| A specific map in a project | `/<workspace name slug>/<project name slug>#<map name slug>` |
| A specific map with a specific view applied | `/<workspace name slug>/<project name slug>#<map name slug>/<view name slug>` |
| A specific element or loop in a map, with the default view applied | `/<workspace name slug>/<project name slug>#<map name slug>/<element or loop label slug>` |
| A specific element or loop in a map, with a different view applied (not the default view) | `/<workspace name slug>/<project name slug>#<map name slug>/<view name slug>/<element or loop label slug>` |
