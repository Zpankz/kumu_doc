# Quick actions

Kumu's quick actions menu is your one-stop-shop for useful functions, features, and how-to videos. If you can't quite remember where to find something in Kumu's [user interfaces](/overview/user-interfaces.md), you can use the quick actions menu to search the entire software.

To bring up the quick actions menu, click the magic wand <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> on the [bottom toolbar](/overview/map-editor.md#bottom-toolbar) or press `W` on your keyboard. You'll be greeted with a list of helpful options:

Search for the feature you're looking for, and the list of options will filter itself to match your keywords.

We're always adding new items to the list of options in the quick actions menu. If you think we missed something important, just email [support@kumu.io](mailto:support@kumu.io) and let us know!
