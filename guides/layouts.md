# Layout
There are a number of layout options available in Kumu, from [fixed layouts](/guides/layouts/fixed.md) where you position things yourself, to [force-directed (floating) layouts](/guides/layouts/force-directed.md) where positions are based on relationships, to scatter plots where positions are driven by underlying field values.

This guide will cover the basics you need for whichever layout you choose.
