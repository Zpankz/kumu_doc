# Add-ons

Kumu offers a number of free and paid add-ons that give your project access to powerful features beyond Kumu's base functionality. All projects (public and private) have access to the same set of add-ons. Add-ons are activated on a project-by-project basis.

To activate add-ons or adjust their settings, open [Project settings](../overview/settings.md#project-settings) and select **Add-ons** from the sidebar.

## Free add-ons

* [Classic SNA Metrics](metrics.md)
* [Community Detection](metrics.md#community-detection)
* [Google Sheets](import/google-sheets.md)
* [Disqus](add-ons/disqus.md)
