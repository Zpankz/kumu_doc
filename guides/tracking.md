Pro workspaces can include a custom Google Analytics tracking id for detailed stats on projects, embeds, and presentations by visiting the tracking section within the settings for your Pro workspace:

To add a tracking id, first [create a new Google Analytics account](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009694?hl=en) (or property within an existing account). As you're creating your property, make sure that you set the URL to `https://kumu.io`:

Copy the tracking id, paste it into the tracking section within the settings for your Pro workspace, and you're all set!
