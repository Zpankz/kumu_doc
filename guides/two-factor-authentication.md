# Two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) helps secure your account and prevent unauthorized access to your data. We strongly recommend managing your MFA with [Authy](https://authy.com/) and enabling backups across multiple devices. We also support [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2\&hl=en).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you lose your device and do not have backups enabled for your MFA information, we will not be able to restore access to your account.
{% endhint %}

To enable two-factor authentication on your account, go to the [2FA section of your settings page](https://kumu.io/settings#2fa) and follow the instructions.

_Note: As of April 28, 2023 we no longer support SMS-based 2FA._
