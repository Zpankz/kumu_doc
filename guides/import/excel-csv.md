# Excel / CSV

After you've [structured your data](import.md), save your spreadsheet file with either the .xlsx or .csv extension (Kumu doesn't support the .xls file extension).

Then, you can import that file into Kumu in two different ways:

**1)** Simply drag and drop the file onto the map's canvas.

OR

**2)** Click the green **+** button at the bottom of your map, select **Import**, and click "Select .xslx file" (this button works for .csv files as well). Then click "Import spreadsheet".&#x20;

Either way, you'll have the option to review the import before finalizing to double-check that everything imported correctly. After you review the import, just click save, and you're all set!
