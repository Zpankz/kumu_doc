# Slugs

In Kumu, a **slug** is a piece of text that has had all letters converted to lowercase, all special characters removed, and all spaces replaced with hyphens. Kumu uses slugs in many different places:

* In the URL bar
* Inside of [selectors](selectors.md)
* In [Markdown](markdown.md)
* In the [Advanced Editor](../overview/view-editors.md#advanced-editor)

Knowing how to recognize, read, and write slugs is a skill that will come in handy, especially if you work in the Advanced Editor! Here are some sample slugs:

| Original text                                                             | Slug                                                                        |
